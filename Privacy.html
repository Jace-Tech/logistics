<p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>

<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>

	<li>Our Platform</li>
</ol>

<p>Any shipment-related data is shared with our relevant internal employees, as well as the service providers you’ve selected.</p>

<p>Shipment Communications.&nbsp;Information communicated within our Company is shared using our internal communication platforms, or through normal digital channels like email or phone. We never ask people to fax us documents though and if a company does, you should encourage them to get with the program.</p>

<p>Shipment Documentation. Shipment documents are stored on the Company, where they can be accessed by the relevant internal Company’s employees or external service providers. When these documents need to be conveyed to external parties, we will typically use digital communication platforms like email or our application.</p>

<ol start="2">
	<li>Communication Archival</li>
</ol>

<p>Regulated users may need to store communications outside of our Service.</p>

<p>Some Site users (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services.</p>

<ol start="3">
	<li>Related Services</li>
</ol>

<p>We share your data across our different Services and Company’s entities. Company’s entities, like our subsidiaries offices around the world, may share your business data internally to provide and develop our Services. We may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to be more relevant and useful to you and others.</p>

<ol start="4">
	<li>Service Providers</li>
</ol>

<p>We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. We’ll make ensure that our partners treat your data with the respect it deserves.</p>

<ol start="5">
	<li>Legal Disclosures</li>
</ol>

<p>We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you, (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, (4) protect the security or integrity of our Service (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of the Company, our users, personnel, or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.</p>

<ol start="6">
	<li>Change in Control or Sale</li>
</ol>

<p>We may share your data if our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="6">
	<li>TRANSFERS OF DATA</li>
</ol>

<p>We use cloud-hosting service providers to provide hosting to us which means that your personal information may be available to foreign government or its agencies under a lawful order, irrespective of the safeguards we have put in place for the protection of your personal information. As privacy laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the privacy laws applicable to the places where your information is transferred to or stored, used or processed in, may be different from the privacy laws applicable to the place where you are resident. However, we will ensure that a similar degree of protection is afforded to your personal information as is provided for under Israel law.</p>

<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>

<p>We do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information.</p>

<ol start="7">
	<li>Data security</li>
</ol>

<p>We use commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain your personal information in a secure environment. We take technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps designed to protect Personal Information that you provide to us. We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions are not stored on the Site and are executed by third parties and will be encrypted using SSL Encryption.</p>

<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Services.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet and mobile platforms is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Site. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="8">
	<li>Data retention</li>
</ol>

<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>

<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request erasure below for further information.</p>

<p>In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

<ol start="9">
	<li>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</li>
</ol>

<p>It is our policy to post any changes we make to our Privacy Policy on this page <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.all-forward.com&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1663493560492570&amp;usg=AOvVaw3c14wXQg0bC4j0RpYx54Kj">www.all-forward.com</a>.

	<li>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</li>
</ol>

<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal information. You may have the right to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Delete Data: You can delete personal data from your profile page or ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you) through this EMAIL : <a href="mailto:support@all-forward.com">support@all-forward.com</a></li>
	<li>Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
	<li>Change or Correct Data: You can edit some of your personal data through your account. You can also ask us to change, update or fix your data in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate.</li>
	<li>Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data: You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).</li>
	<li>Right to Access and/or Take Your Data: You can ask us for a copy of your personal data and can ask for a copy of personal data you provided in machine readable form.</li>
	<li>Request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may contact us using the contact information below, and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.</p>

<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>

<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>

<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p></main>
