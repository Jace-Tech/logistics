vs. Freight Forwarder","Title":"The Difference Between An NVOCC And A Freight Forwarder","SubTitle":"What is the difference between a NVOCC and a Freight Forwarder?","Text":"<h1>Introduction</h1>\n\n<p>Whether you’re shipping across the country or halfway around the world, you’ll need to arrange ocean transportation at some point. This can be a complicated process, especially if you don’t have experience with international shipping. In this post we’ll go over what an NVOCC and freight forwarder are, their differences, and when each would be useful in your business operations.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>What is an NVOCC?</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>NVOCC stands for “non-vessel operating common carrier.” An NVOCC is an ocean carrier, providing transportation services almost exactly like a steamship line—but unlike most of them, the NVOCC does not own or operate its own ships—it just sources space on cargo vessels from other carriers and resells it to customers.</p>\n\n<p>If you have ever booked transportation through a freight forwarder or logistics company like us here at Transplace, then you may have ended up booking with an NVOCC as well.</p>\n\n<p>The difference between an NVOCC and other freight companies (such as freight forwarders or logistics companies) lies in their business model. While they both offer similar services (i.e., booking transportation), the way they go about doing so is different:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>What is a Freight Forwarder?</h2>\n\n<p>A freight forwarder is an agent that arranges for the movement of cargo from one place to another. They are not a carrier and do not own any assets, but they take responsibility for the paperwork, customs clearance and logistics for their customers. Freight forwarders work with carriers (e.g., airlines) to arrange transportation for their customers.</p>\n\n<p>Some companies may also be called freight brokers or freight agents</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Are an NVOCC and a freight forwarder the same thing?</h2>\n\n<p>While NVOCC and freight forwarder are often used interchangeably, they're not the same thing. They do share some similarities, though: both provide ocean transportation services and are involved in the shipping process. However, as you may have guessed from their names (NVOCC stands for \"non-vessel operating common carrier\"), NVOCCs are ocean carriers whereas freight forwarders are logistics companies.</p>\n\n<p>To put it another way: NVOCCs own ships and containers; freight forwarders do not. This means that an NVOCC can provide its clients with door-to-door service throughout the entire shipping process (from picking up a shipment at one location to delivering it at another), but a freight forwarder must work with a third party—the actual shipper or carrier—in order to arrange pick-up/delivery of goods on behalf of its client(s).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>How do I choose between them?</h2>\n\n<p>When it comes to choosing between NVOCCs and freight forwarders, the most important thing is that you choose the one that best meets your needs. If you want cheaper rates but don't need much in the way of services, an NVOCC may be a good choice for you. Conversely, if price isn't much of an issue and you need a lot of services, then a freight forwarder might be more suitable. You can also choose a mix of both; some companies offer their own shipping rates through an NVOCC while also taking advantage of other companies' lower prices when booking shipments through them.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Both NVOCCs and freight forwarders can help you arrange ocean transportation, but they each do it differently. It’s important to understand their differences before deciding which one to use.</h2>\n\n<p>Both NVOCCs and freight forwarders can help you arrange ocean transportation, but they each do it differently. It's important to understand their differences before deciding which one to use.</p>\n\n<p>NVOCCs are not carriers, they are agents. When you hire them, they will arrange ocean transportation for your cargo with a carrier on your behalf.

The trick is figuring out how to take advantage of these connections. Here are some key factors to consider as you book shipments through an alliance:</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2>What Are Ocean Alliances?</h2>\n\n<p>Ocean alliances are cooperative groups of carriers that commit to vessel-sharing agreements in order to help cover as much of the ocean shipping market as possible. These agreements enable the participating carriers to reduce their costs by sharing vessels, crew and port facilities.</p>\n\n<p>Ocean alliances are a relatively new concept, but they have been gaining momentum over the last few years. Currently, there are six major ocean alliances operating: The Alliance (The Alliance), Ocean Network Express (ONE), P3 Network (P3N), NYK Line/Hana World Wide Freight Forwarding/NYK Logistics System/Mitsui O.S.K Lines Group Joint Service Agreement (JSA), OOCL group and 2M2L group</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2>Which Carriers Are in Which Alliance?</h2>\n\n<p>Now that you're familiar with the major alliances and their roles in the industry, let's break down which carriers are in which.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The 2M Alliance is made up of MSC, MAERSK and ZIM.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Ocean Alliance is made up of CMA- CGM, COSCO, OOCL (purchased by Cosco), and EVERGREEN.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>THE Alliance includes HAPAG LLOYD (HHJ), NYK, YANG MING, MOL, K-LINE and HYUNDAI MERCHANT MARINE (HMM).</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2>Technology Standardization</h2>\n\n<p>The first step in standardization is the creation of a single technology platform for carriers to use. This allows them to share information and data, as well as make decisions more quickly than they could before. With access to data from all the carriers involved in an alliance, there are many opportunities for carriers to improve their operations. For example, knowing which routes are most profitable at any given time can help increase efficiency by steering ships away from less-productive areas and toward those with higher returns.</p>\n\n<p>Another benefit of technology standardization is that it makes communication between carriers easier than ever before. Instead of having separate systems for managing their operations and communicating with each other about cargo shipments, members of an ocean alliance now have one system that allows them all to communicate seamlessly with each other through a common platform</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2>Where Does Each Ocean Alliance Ship?</h2>\n\n<p>Ocean Alliances, like their real-world counterparts, are made up of ships that carry goods and passengers around the world. They provide an efficient and affordable way to travel between ports all over the globe.</p>\n\n<p>Each ocean alliance serves a specific geographic region, defined by trade lanes that connect major cities like New York City with San Francisco; Hong Kong with Singapore; London with Amsterdam; Cape Town with Bangkok; and so on. Each alliance has its own headquarters in one of these cities where you can find offices for shipping companies or other businesses that need to ship goods or passengers through that particular region's trade routes.</p>\n\n<p>Each ocean alliance also serves dozens of ports along its trade routes—each port has a pier where cargo ships dock, allowing them to load and unload everything from apples to cars onto their decks before sailing off again on their next leg of the journey.</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2>Booking Strategies</h2>\n\n<p>When it comes to booking strategies, it's important to understand the difference between the three alliances.</p>\n\n<p>Each alliance serves a different mix of trade lanes and preferred ports. For example, Maersk Line has access to ports in South America, North America, and Europe. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) also offers services throughout Europe but also has routes for Asia-Pacific and Africa/Middle East shipping. Finally, CMA CGM operates from all over the world with a focus on connecting Europe with Africa/Middle East countries such as Egypt or Morocco through its West Coast Express Line service—which is run by a sister company called Grand Alliance Ltd.—and onto Australia via its Southern Cross Line service —which is operated by another sister company called Pacific International Lines Co Ltd (PIL).</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2>See what else you can get through an alliance.</h2>\n\n<p>An alliance is a community of like-minded businesses that work together to help each other grow. The members of an alliance share resources, expertise and experiences with their partners, creating opportunities for everyone involved. If you're interested in becoming part of an alliance, check out the list below:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Which alliances are near you?</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>How far do they cover?</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>How many ports do they have?</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Do they offer any other services besides shipping or logistics?</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>With so many alliances and carriers available, it can be hard to know which one to pick. But with the right booking strategy, you can use the benefits of ocean alliances to save time, money and hassle. The best thing about this system is that you have a choice: if one alliance doesn’t work for your shipment, there are plenty of others out there!</p>","Tags":"Ocean Alliances, Shipping Lines","Suffix":"OceanAlliances","HeroImage":"BlogsImages/00000/00000002_2wnnlaeusmuaw.jpg","CardImage":"BlogsImages/00000/00000002_e3ehtsevwo4rk.jpg","RelatedBlogIds":null,"Created":"2023-01-05T00:00:00","TagsNames":null,"RelatedBlogs":null},{"Id":4,"Active":true,"Name":"What are the Factors that Influence Ocean Freight Rates?","Title":"What are the Factors that Influence Ocean Freight Rates?","SubTitle":"There are a number of factors that affect shipping rates, and understanding them will help you make the best decisions","Text":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Did you ever wonder why some corridors are more expensive than others, what causes fluctuations in freight rates and how ocean freight is determined?</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of factors that affect shipping rates, and knowing them will help you make the best decisions. Here are the main ones:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Shipping route and distance</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Shipping costs vary based on factors like the distance between your original pick-up point, and the final destination. The longer the distance, the higher the shipping cost. But freight rates also depend on geographic location, transportation move and complexity of the delivery. If you are shipping merchandise to a location that is difficult/ remote or expensive to reach, rates will be higher.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Seasonality</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When demand is high and supply of space limited, shipping companies may charge a premium. During peak seasons, shipping companies raise their rates to take advantage of the high demand and compensate for lower rates in off-peak months.</p>\n\n<p>Holidays affect the floating of ocean freight in several ways. For example, Christmas, Chinese New Year and Ramadan are all significant holidays that occur in different parts of the world—and their effects on global commerce can be usually seen before they begin when ocean freight rates increase as preparation.</p>\n\n<p>Another seasonality is cargo related. For certain types of cargo (vegetables, fruit, grain), seasonality is important as these items tend to be shipped during a particular period every year, and have higher freight rates.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Type and size of container</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The size and type of the container will also affect the cost. For instance, 40' HC container will cost more than a smaller 20' container, and an Open top container will cost more than a regular container. A reefer will cost more than a dry container.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Cargo type</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When shipping dangerous goods that require special storage and handling, you will pay a higher freight rate because of the costs associated with handling them.</p>\n\n<p>Oversized cargo takes up more space aboard vessels and requires special handling, which makes it more expensive than standard-sized containers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Fuel Cost</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The fuel cost fluctuations also affect ocean freight. When there is an increase in oil prices, ocean shipping companies will charge more for their services—and pass the additional costs onto businesses requesting shipments. Conversely, when fuel prices decrease many businesses can afford to ship goods using lower-priced sea freight.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Currency</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While different countries use different currencies, the dollar is used as a standard unit of international currency in transactions. Therefore, ocean freight rates are affected by the currency exchange rate at the moment of transaction, and companies should keep track of currency fluctuations so that they will not be surprised by higher costs than expected.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Service charges</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Port service charges and terminal fees affect shipping rates as well. Depending on your origin and destination, you may have to pay different local charges on top of the port's charge of THC (Terminal handling cost).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Competition</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the current shipping economy, rates are affected by many factors—the number of competitors and their strength in the market position among them. In today's shipping industry, you'll see that competition is no longer strictly limited to ocean transport: land service and transport have become important areas as well.</p>\n\n<p>Carriers often adjust their freight rates to ensure they get the largest possible share of traffic, which affects prices. if a carrier is fighting for market share this can heavily influence rates given to customers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","Tags":"Ocean rate, freight, rates","Suffix":"Oceanrate","HeroImage":"BlogsImages/00000/00000004_ukgqbssxksbwy.jpg","CardImage":"BlogsImages/00000/00000004_5dwxnosbl5ozk.jpg","RelatedBlogIds":null,"Created":"2023-02-13T00:00:00","TagsNames":null,"RelatedBlogs":null},{"Id":5,"Active":true,"Name":"Differences between Digital and Traditional Freight Forwarding","Title":"Differences between Digital and Traditional Freight Forwarding","SubTitle":"How have recent developments in information technology and automation changed the face of freight forwarding?","Text":"<p>As the world continues to digitize and becomes increasingly automated, almost all traditional fields of work are being affected—and Freight forwarding is no exception. The digital freight forwarding industry has been rapidly growing in recent years, as more companies have begun operating online and offering services that traditionally were handled by long-established traditional freight forwarders. In our fast paced world, velocity is one of the main keys. Customers are connected via their mobile devices, so they can track/ approach suppliers at any time and from any place, and usually expect fast, online responses, especially within working hours.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In this article, we will review the differences between traditional and digital freight forwarding, as well as the different Pros and Cons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>What are the differences between traditional and digital freight forwarding?</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Contact with customer: Fast replies and immediate answers have become basic ingredients in today’s customer experience expectation.

Traditional Freight Forwarders will usually correspond over a number of mails until the last version is approved and they can pick it up/ download from the website. Digital Freight Forwarders have a platform that allows them to share the documents online with the customer.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Track &amp; Trace: Customers expect to be able to check and receive live updates on the shipments, without having to contact the shipper/ consignee/ freight forwarder and wait for a reply.

This can be a complicated process, especially if you don’t have experience with international shipping. In this post we’ll go over what an NVOCC and freight forwarder are, their differences, and when each would be useful in your business operations.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>What is an NVOCC?</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>NVOCC stands for “non-vessel operating common carrier.” An NVOCC is an ocean carrier, providing transportation services almost exactly like a steamship line—but unlike most of them, the NVOCC does not own or operate its own ships—it just sources space on cargo vessels from other carriers and resells it to customers.</p>\n\n<p>If you have ever booked transportation through a freight forwarder or logistics company like us here at Transplace, then you may have ended up booking with an NVOCC as well.</p>\n\n<p>The difference between an NVOCC and other freight companies (such as freight forwarders or logistics companies) lies in their business model. While they both offer similar services (i.e., booking transportation), the way they go about doing so is different:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>What is a Freight Forwarder?</h2>\n\n<p>A freight forwarder is an agent that arranges for the movement of cargo from one place to another. They are not a carrier and do not own any assets, but they take responsibility for the paperwork, customs clearance and logistics for their customers. Freight forwarders work with carriers (e.g., airlines) to arrange transportation for their customers.</p>\n\n<p>Some companies may also be called freight brokers or freight agents</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Are an NVOCC and a freight forwarder the same thing?</h2>\n\n<p>While NVOCC and freight forwarder are often used interchangeably, they're not the same thing. They do share some similarities, though: both provide ocean transportation services and are involved in the shipping process. However, as you may have guessed from their names (NVOCC stands for \"non-vessel operating common carrier\"), NVOCCs are ocean carriers whereas freight forwarders are logistics companies.</p>\n\n<p>To put it another way: NVOCCs own ships and containers; freight forwarders do not. This means that an NVOCC can provide its clients with door-to-door service throughout the entire shipping process (from picking up a shipment at one location to delivering it at another), but a freight forwarder must work with a third party—the actual shipper or carrier—in order to arrange pick-up/delivery of goods on behalf of its client(s).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>How do I choose between them?</h2>\n\n<p>When it comes to choosing between NVOCCs and freight forwarders, the most important thing is that you choose the one that best meets your needs. If you want cheaper rates but don't need much in the way of services, an NVOCC may be a good choice for you. Conversely, if price isn't much of an issue and you need a lot of services, then a freight forwarder might be more suitable. You can also choose a mix of both; some companies offer their own shipping rates through an NVOCC while also taking advantage of other companies' lower prices when booking shipments through them.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Both NVOCCs and freight forwarders can help you arrange ocean transportation, but they each do it differently. It’s important to understand their differences before deciding which one to use.</h2>\n\n<p>Both NVOCCs and freight forwarders can help you arrange ocean transportation, but they each do it differently. It's important to understand their differences before deciding which one to use.</p>\n\n<p>NVOCCs are not carriers, they are agents. When you hire them, they will arrange ocean transportation for your cargo with a carrier on your behalf.

The trick is figuring out how to take advantage of these connections. Here are some key factors to consider as you book shipments through an alliance:</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2>What Are Ocean Alliances?</h2>\n\n<p>Ocean alliances are cooperative groups of carriers that commit to vessel-sharing agreements in order to help cover as much of the ocean shipping market as possible. These agreements enable the participating carriers to reduce their costs by sharing vessels, crew and port facilities.</p>\n\n<p>Ocean alliances are a relatively new concept, but they have been gaining momentum over the last few years. Currently, there are six major ocean alliances operating: The Alliance (The Alliance), Ocean Network Express (ONE), P3 Network (P3N), NYK Line/Hana World Wide Freight Forwarding/NYK Logistics System/Mitsui O.S.K Lines Group Joint Service Agreement (JSA), OOCL group and 2M2L group</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2>Which Carriers Are in Which Alliance?</h2>\n\n<p>Now that you're familiar with the major alliances and their roles in the industry, let's break down which carriers are in which.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The 2M Alliance is made up of MSC, MAERSK and ZIM.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Ocean Alliance is made up of CMA- CGM, COSCO, OOCL (purchased by Cosco), and EVERGREEN.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>THE Alliance includes HAPAG LLOYD (HHJ), NYK, YANG MING, MOL, K-LINE and HYUNDAI MERCHANT MARINE (HMM).</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2>Technology Standardization</h2>\n\n<p>The first step in standardization is the creation of a single technology platform for carriers to use. This allows them to share information and data, as well as make decisions more quickly than they could before. With access to data from all the carriers involved in an alliance, there are many opportunities for carriers to improve their operations. For example, knowing which routes are most profitable at any given time can help increase efficiency by steering ships away from less-productive areas and toward those with higher returns.</p>\n\n<p>Another benefit of technology standardization is that it makes communication between carriers easier than ever before. Instead of having separate systems for managing their operations and communicating with each other about cargo shipments, members of an ocean alliance now have one system that allows them all to communicate seamlessly with each other through a common platform</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2>Where Does Each Ocean Alliance Ship?</h2>\n\n<p>Ocean Alliances, like their real-world counterparts, are made up of ships that carry goods and passengers around the world. They provide an efficient and affordable way to travel between ports all over the globe.</p>\n\n<p>Each ocean alliance serves a specific geographic region, defined by trade lanes that connect major cities like New York City with San Francisco; Hong Kong with Singapore; London with Amsterdam; Cape Town with Bangkok; and so on. Each alliance has its own headquarters in one of these cities where you can find offices for shipping companies or other businesses that need to ship goods or passengers through that particular region's trade routes.</p>\n\n<p>Each ocean alliance also serves dozens of ports along its trade routes—each port has a pier where cargo ships dock, allowing them to load and unload everything from apples to cars onto their decks before sailing off again on their next leg of the journey.</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2>Booking Strategies</h2>\n\n<p>When it comes to booking strategies, it's important to understand the difference between the three alliances.</p>\n\n<p>Each alliance serves a different mix of trade lanes and preferred ports. For example, Maersk Line has access to ports in South America, North America, and Europe. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) also offers services throughout Europe but also has routes for Asia-Pacific and Africa/Middle East shipping. Finally, CMA CGM operates from all over the world with a focus on connecting Europe with Africa/Middle East countries such as Egypt or Morocco through its West Coast Express Line service—which is run by a sister company called Grand Alliance Ltd.—and onto Australia via its Southern Cross Line service —which is operated by another sister company called Pacific International Lines Co Ltd (PIL).</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2>See what else you can get through an alliance.</h2>\n\n<p>An alliance is a community of like-minded businesses that work together to help each other grow. The members of an alliance share resources, expertise and experiences with their partners, creating opportunities for everyone involved. If you're interested in becoming part of an alliance, check out the list below:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Which alliances are near you?</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>How far do they cover?</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>How many ports do they have?</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Do they offer any other services besides shipping or logistics?</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>With so many alliances and carriers available, it can be hard to know which one to pick. But with the right booking strategy, you can use the benefits of ocean alliances to save time, money and hassle. The best thing about this system is that you have a choice: if one alliance doesn’t work for your shipment, there are plenty of others out there!</p>","Tags":"Ocean Alliances, Shipping Lines","Suffix":"OceanAlliances","HeroImage":"BlogsImages/00000/00000002_2wnnlaeusmuaw.jpg","CardImage":"BlogsImages/00000/00000002_e3ehtsevwo4rk.jpg","RelatedBlogIds":null,"Created":"2023-01-05T00:00:00","TagsNames":null,"RelatedBlogs":null},{"Id":4,"Active":true,"Name":"What are the Factors that Influence Ocean Freight Rates?","Title":"What are the Factors that Influence Ocean Freight Rates?","SubTitle":"There are a number of factors that affect shipping rates, and understanding them will help you make the best decisions","Text":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Did you ever wonder why some corridors are more expensive than others, what causes fluctuations in freight rates and how ocean freight is determined?</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of factors that affect shipping rates, and knowing them will help you make the best decisions. Here are the main ones:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Shipping route and distance</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Shipping costs vary based on factors like the distance between your original pick-up point, and the final destination. The longer the distance, the higher the shipping cost. But freight rates also depend on geographic location, transportation move and complexity of the delivery. If you are shipping merchandise to a location that is difficult/ remote or expensive to reach, rates will be higher.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Seasonality</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When demand is high and supply of space limited, shipping companies may charge a premium. During peak seasons, shipping companies raise their rates to take advantage of the high demand and compensate for lower rates in off-peak months.</p>\n\n<p>Holidays affect the floating of ocean freight in several ways. For example, Christmas, Chinese New Year and Ramadan are all significant holidays that occur in different parts of the world—and their effects on global commerce can be usually seen before they begin when ocean freight rates increase as preparation.</p>\n\n<p>Another seasonality is cargo related. For certain types of cargo (vegetables, fruit, grain), seasonality is important as these items tend to be shipped during a particular period every year, and have higher freight rates.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Type and size of container</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The size and type of the container will also affect the cost. For instance, 40' HC container will cost more than a smaller 20' container, and an Open top container will cost more than a regular container. A reefer will cost more than a dry container.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Cargo type</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When shipping dangerous goods that require special storage and handling, you will pay a higher freight rate because of the costs associated with handling them.</p>\n\n<p>Oversized cargo takes up more space aboard vessels and requires special handling, which makes it more expensive than standard-sized containers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Fuel Cost</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The fuel cost fluctuations also affect ocean freight. When there is an increase in oil prices, ocean shipping companies will charge more for their services—and pass the additional costs onto businesses requesting shipments. Conversely, when fuel prices decrease many businesses can afford to ship goods using lower-priced sea freight.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Currency</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While different countries use different currencies, the dollar is used as a standard unit of international currency in transactions. Therefore, ocean freight rates are affected by the currency exchange rate at the moment of transaction, and companies should keep track of currency fluctuations so that they will not be surprised by higher costs than expected.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Service charges</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Port service charges and terminal fees affect shipping rates as well. Depending on your origin and destination, you may have to pay different local charges on top of the port's charge of THC (Terminal handling cost).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Competition</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the current shipping economy, rates are affected by many factors—the number of competitors and their strength in the market position among them. In today's shipping industry, you'll see that competition is no longer strictly limited to ocean transport: land service and transport have become important areas as well.</p>\n\n<p>Carriers often adjust their freight rates to ensure they get the largest possible share of traffic, which affects prices. if a carrier is fighting for market share this can heavily influence rates given to customers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","Tags":"Ocean rate, freight, rates","Suffix":"Oceanrate","HeroImage":"BlogsImages/00000/00000004_ukgqbssxksbwy.jpg","CardImage":"BlogsImages/00000/00000004_5dwxnosbl5ozk.jpg","RelatedBlogIds":null,"Created":"2023-02-13T00:00:00","TagsNames":null,"RelatedBlogs":null},{"Id":5,"Active":true,"Name":"Differences between Digital and Traditional Freight Forwarding","Title":"Differences between Digital and Traditional Freight Forwarding","SubTitle":"How have recent developments in information technology and automation changed the face of freight forwarding?","Text":"<p>As the world continues to digitize and becomes increasingly automated, almost all traditional fields of work are being affected—and Freight forwarding is no exception. The digital freight forwarding industry has been rapidly growing in recent years, as more companies have begun operating online and offering services that traditionally were handled by long-established traditional freight forwarders. In our fast paced world, velocity is one of the main keys. Customers are connected via their mobile devices, so they can track/ approach suppliers at any time and from any place, and usually expect fast, online responses, especially within working hours.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In this article, we will review the differences between traditional and digital freight forwarding, as well as the different Pros and Cons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>What are the differences between traditional and digital freight forwarding?</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Contact with customer: Fast replies and immediate answers have become basic ingredients in today’s customer experience expectation. Traditional Freight Forwarders will usually use the phone, sometimes mail to contact customers. Digital Freight Forwarders will use immediate communication tools like mail, chat and are usually connected via different communication flows to insure immediate response.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Receiving a quote: Traditional Freight Forwarders will usually quote the carrier that best fits the customer’s needs based on the carriers they work with. If you want to compare different quotes, you’ll have to do it manually. Digital Freight Forwarders provide a platform where you can check and compare yourself within minutes.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Documentation: Shipping documentation is a major and crucial part of every shipment. Traditional Freight Forwarders will usually correspond over a number of mails until the last version is approved and they can pick it up/ download from the website. Digital Freight Forwarders have a platform that allows them to share the documents online with the customer.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Track &amp; Trace: Customers expect to be able to check and receive live updates on the shipments, without having to contact the shipper/ consignee/ freight forwarder and wait for a reply. Traditional freight forwarders struggle with this, while digital freight forwarders connect their systems to different tracking tools that allow that, and give a visible real time tracking experience to their customers.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While digital freight forwarders have an advantage over their traditional counterparts in many ways, we can see that many of those older companies are adapting to the new world and digitizing themselves as well, in order to remain competitive. We should also keep in mind that despite their advantages over traditional freight forwarders, digital freight forwarding companies will have to keep modernizing in order to keep pace with the growing competition. With additional technologies around the corner, like AI, Machine learning, Blockchain and more, we can expect to see more rapid developments already in the near future.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","Tags":"digital freight forwarding, freight forwarding","Suffix":"digital freight forwarding","HeroImage":"BlogsImages/00000/00000005_zcjduud7hlep2.jpg","CardImage":"BlogsImages/00000/00000005_kq3rwxsy73yos.jpg","RelatedBlogIds":null,"Created":"2023-02-14T00:00:00","TagsNames":null,"RelatedBlogs":null}];
