<p>Last Revised: February 1st, 2022</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following Terms of Use, including the terms of All Forward Ltd.’s Privacy Policy (available at: all-forward.com (the “Terms”)), constitute the legal agreement which governs and applies to your use of this website, available at all-forward.com (the “Website”) and your registration and use of the online platform (the “Platform”), all maintained and owned by All Forward Ltd.</p>

<p>The Terms set forth herein apply to any content and information that are or become available on the Website (collectively, the “Content”). By accessing and/or using the Website or the Platform, you acknowledge that you have read and that you agree to be bound by the Terms, without any limitation or qualification. If you do not agree to the Terms, do not connect to, access or use the Website or the Platform in any manner whatsoever. Both the Website and the Platform is available only to individuals who possess the legal authority to enter into these Terms and to form a binding agreement under any applicable law.</p>

<p>In these Terms, "we", "us", "our" and "Company" refer to All Forward Ltd., and "you" and "your" refer to you, the user of Our Website.</p>

<p>THESE TERMS INCLUDE AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT.</p>

<p>We may modify these Terms for any reason—at any time—by posting a new version on Our Website; these changes do not affect rights and obligations that arose prior to such changes. Your continued use of Our Website or Platform following the posting of modified Terms will be subject to the Terms in effect at the time of your use. Please review these Terms periodically for changes. If you object to any provision of these Terms or any subsequent modifications to these Terms or become dissatisfied with Our Website in any way, your only recourse is to immediately terminate use of our Website and/or Platform.</p>

<p>IF CUSTOMER REGISTERS FOR FREE SERVICES, THE APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THIS TERMS WILL ALSO GOVERN THOSE FREE SERVICES.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Freight Forwarding Services</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li>Our Website is a freight forwarding (“Forwarding”) search engine (the “Engine”). The Engine enables Providers (as defined below) to contact between them, request bids and to cooperate.</li>
	<li>The Platform enables users to initiate, conclude, process and administrate chargeable contracts with the provider on the shipment of goods and other logistics services. &nbsp;The Company does not own or control any of the Forwarding services and products that you can access through our Platform, such as shipment, customs clearance, warehousing, insurance (the “Products”). The Products are owned, controlled or made available by third parties (the “Providers”) either directly or as an agent. The Providers are responsible for the Products and the Forwarding services. The Provider’s terms and privacy policies apply to your booking/shipping order so you must agree to and understand those terms. Your interaction with any Provider accessed through our Website is at your own risk; the Company does not bear any responsibility should anything go wrong with your Booking or shipment. It is hereby clarified that the Company, or anyone in her name, may be one of the Providers in the Platform.</li>
</ol>

<p>The display on our Website/Platform of a Product or Provider does not—in any way—imply, suggest, or constitute a recommendation by the Company of that Product or Provider, &nbsp;or any sponsorship or approval of the Company by such Provider, or any affiliation between such Provider and the Company. Without derogating from the foregoing, you acknowledge that Providers which are Affiliates of the Company may be displayed in our Website/Platform. For the purpose of these Terms, “Affiliates” shall mean any corporation, firm, partnership, employee, or other natural or legal person which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company.</p>

<p>Our Website and Platform hosts Content, including prices, made available by or obtained from Providers. By making a booking through the Website, you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the Provider at which you book. From that point, the Company shall act solely as an intermediary between you and the Providers, transmitting the details of your booking to the relevant Provider and sending you a confirmation email for and on behalf of the Provider.</p>

<p>Without derogating from the above, by making a booking through the Platform, you enter into contractual relationship with the Company. You may choose to purchase insurance for your shipment through the Company, but if you choose not to purchase an insurance, then the Company does not bear any responsibility should anything go wrong with your Booking or shipment.</p>

<p>The Company is in no way responsible for the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of any content published by third parties, Providers etc. in the Website or in the Platform. Since the Company has no control over the Products and/or Providers and does not verify the content uploaded by the Providers, it is not possible for us to guarantee the prices displayed on our Website/Platform. Prices change constantly and additional charges (e.g., payment fees, services charges, local taxes and fees) may apply, so you should always check whether the price asked for a booking is the one you expected. Some Products may also be sold in another currency than the one preset or chosen by you for the display of the search results. Our currency conversion is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as accurate or real time; actual rates may vary, and your payment provider (e.g., your credit card company) may charge conversion fees and apply another date’s currency rate.</p>

<p>The Company may extend the scope of services of the Engine or the Platform at any point of time. The Company reserves the right to limit individual functions temporarily or permanently, when this is technically necessary, or the conducted changes are only minor. Non-minor changes will be announced in good time prior to their application by the Company if there are no compelling technical or legal reasons to the contrary. If the Provider offers additional functions free of charge after the conclusion of the contract with you, the Provider is entitled to discontinue these functions at any time without prior notification.</p>

<p>Each Provider remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness and correctness of the information (including the rates and availability) displayed on the Website/Platform.</p>

<p>3. Intellectual Property</p>
